  <h1>DIAGRAM Accessible Math Input Project</h1>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>The WAVES Token Toolbar is a simple software utility for creating and reading mathematical equations and formulas in the MathML format, which is commonly used in online learning and in materials for blind and low-vision computer users. The software facilitates interaction with online learning systems, with the ultimate goal of assisting blind and visually impaired students in adapting to an increasingly online educational environment.</p>
  <p>The WAVES Toolbar uses a special interface to build unambiguous math equations. This is important for blind users because positional elements (like where a numerator begins and ends) have to be described using audio, and thus must be clear and concise. The core element is a toolbar containing buttons representing specific math symbols and operators (collectively known as <strong>tokens</strong>). The tokens in the toolbar are arranged according to how often they are used in the math subject being worked with. </p>
  <p>In the case of this 1.0 release of the WAVES Toolbar software, the toolbar is designed to support a high-school-level Algebra I curriculum. Because the interface prioritizes tokens based on their frequency of use, it may be initially surprising to find most “standard” calculator buttons missing from the toolbar, but one must remember that most basic operators (plus, minus, division, equals, parentheses) are readily available on the keyboard, and that algebra problems are often light on arithmetic. </p>
