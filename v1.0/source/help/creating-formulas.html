  <h2>Creating Math Constructs in the Formula List</h2>
  <p>Much of what is seen in the Formula List is generated automatically by the WAVES Toolbar. The line numbers are always added when needed, and the token identifier is inserted when you press that token's button in the toolbar. The only things you need to type in are the numbers, variables, and operators of the equation itself. For an example, we'll look at the "x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1 = 0" equation from above.</p>
  <p>Using the keyboard, you simply start with the "superscript" token button, which automatically creates all the lines in the Formula List. Then, type in "+2x+1=0" to complete the overall basic structure of the equation, and then enter "x" for the exponent's base and "2" for the superscript, completing the construct. You can navigate freely through the construct with the arrow keys, so the order of entry can be handled however you like; for example, in this case, you could enter the terms for the exponential expression first, and then go up to finish typing in the rest of the equation (which may be more intuitive for some users). </p>
  <p>As you type, MathML is automatically rendered in the background, and the normal-text version is displayed in the Text Box at the bottom of the toolbar window. The MathML and can be exported or copy/pasted into another application as needed; until then, you don't need to see or work with the raw MathML code at all. </p>
